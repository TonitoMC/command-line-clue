Detective's Initial Report:

Earlier today, The Artist reported seeing an unexpected light in the park.

This seems like a good place to start our investigation. Remember to:
- Use 'cd' to move between locations
- Use 'ls' to list the contents of each location
- Use 'cat' to read any text files you find
